# InkSpace: Tattoo Booth & Artist Discovery Platform

InkSpace is a dual-platform application designed to revolutionize the tattoo industry. It serves as a B2B marketplace for tattoo artists to find and book booths at shops (like an Airbnb for tattoo spaces) and a B2C discovery tool for clients to find and book sessions with available artists in their city.

2.  Choose a strong database password and save it securely.
3.  Once the project is created, navigate to **Project Settings > API**.
4.  Copy the **Project URL** and the **`anon` `public` key**.
5.  Paste these into your `.env` file as `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.

#### B. Run the Database Schema SQL
1.  In your Supabase project, navigate to the **SQL Editor** from the left-hand menu.
2.  Click **+ New query**.
3.  Copy the entire SQL script below and paste it into the editor.
4.  Click the green **RUN** button. This will create all the necessary tables and security policies.

#### C. Set Up Supabase Storage
The app requires two storage "buckets" for image uploads.
1.  Navigate to **Storage** from the left-hand menu.
2.  Click **+ New Bucket** and create a **public** bucket named `portfolios`.
3.  Click **+ New Bucket** again and create a **public** bucket named `message_attachments`.
4.  Next, you **must** create security policies for these buckets. Navigate to **Storage > Policies**.
5.  Create a new policy for the `portfolios` bucket with the following details:
    - **Policy Name:** `Allow authenticated uploads to portfolios`
    - **Allowed operations:** `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`
    - **Target roles:** `authenticated`
    - **Policy Definition (USING expression):** `(bucket_id = 'portfolios'::text)`
    - **Policy Definition (WITH CHECK expression):** `(bucket_id = 'portfolios'::text)`
6.  Create a new policy for the `message_attachments` bucket:
    - **Policy Name:** `Allow authenticated uploads to attachments`
    - **Allowed operations:** `SELECT`, `INSERT`
    - **Target roles:** `authenticated`
    - **Policy Definition (USING expression):** `(bucket_id = 'message_attachments'::text)`
    - **Policy Definition (WITH CHECK expression):** `(bucket_id = 'message_attachments'::text)`


### 6. Running the Application
Once your setup is complete, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Troubleshooting Wiki

If you encounter issues, check here first.

### Connection Issues / "Failed to fetch"
This is the most common error and is almost always related to Supabase setup.

1.  **Check `.env` Variables:** Double-check that `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are correct and have no extra spaces or characters.
2.  **Check RLS Policies:** The error "Failed to fetch initial data" often means Row Level Security is blocking the app from reading public data. Go to **Authentication > Policies** in Supabase and ensure that you have policies enabling `SELECT` access for `public.profiles`, `public.shops`, etc., as defined in the schema script.
3.  **Check Browser Console:** Open your browser's developer tools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I) and look at the **Network** tab. If you see requests to Supabase failing with a 401 or 403 error, it confirms an authentication or RLS issue.

### Google Maps Not Loading
1.  **Check API Key:** Ensure `VITE_MAPS_API_KEY` in your `.env` is correct.
2.  **Enable APIs:** In your Google Cloud Console, make sure you have enabled the **Maps JavaScript API** and the **Places API**.
3.  **API Key Restrictions:** If you have restricted your API key, ensure your development URL (e.g., `localhost:5173`) is included in the allowed HTTP referrers.

### Gemini AI Features Not Working
1.  **Check API Key:** Ensure `VITE_API_KEY` in your `.env` is correct.
2.  **Enable API:** In your Google Cloud Console, make sure you have enabled the **Generative Language API** (also known as the Gemini API).

### Image Uploads Fail
This is almost always a Supabase Storage policy issue.
1.  **Public Buckets:** Confirm that both `portfolios` and `message_attachments` buckets exist and are marked as "Public".
2.  **Storage RLS Policies:** Go to **Storage > Policies** in your Supabase dashboard. Verify you have policies that allow `authenticated` users to perform `INSERT` operations on both buckets. Refer to the [Storage Setup](#c-set-up-supabase-storage) section for the exact policies.

### Authentication Errors (Login/Signup)
1.  **Email Confirmation:** By default, Supabase requires users to confirm their email. For development, you can disable this by going to **Authentication > Providers > Email** and turning off "Confirm email".
2.  **Check RLS for `profiles` Table:** A new user signup can fail if the RLS policy for `INSERT` on the `profiles` table is missing. The provided schema script includes this, but it's worth checking if you're having issues.

## Project Structure
-   `src/components/`: Contains all React components, organized by views, shared elements, and modals.
-   `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks, including the main state management store (`useAppStore.ts`).
-   `src/services/`: Modules for interacting with external APIs (Supabase, Gemini, Google Maps).
-   `src/types.ts`: Centralized TypeScript type definitions for the entire application.
-   `src/data/`: Contains static data, such as dropdown options for forms.

## Future Roadmap
-   **Stripe Integration:** Implement real payment processing for booth rentals and client deposits.
-   **Advanced Search Filters:** Add more granular filters (e.g., artist ratings, shop amenities).
-   **Personalized Recommendations:** Use AI to suggest artists to clients and shops to artists.
-   **Push Notifications:** Implement real-time push notifications for a more engaging experience.
